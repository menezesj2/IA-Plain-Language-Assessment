# IA Plain Language Assessment Project - Menezes, J (2025)

The main scripts in this project (_Automated Textual Analysis - *.py_) read PDF documents and calculate readability and similarity metrics for the documents. In the context of this project, I am analysing Initial Project Descriptions (IPDs) and thier Plain Language Summaries (PLSs) created under the Canadian _Impact Assessment Act_, 2019. The code calculates similarity metrics for each pair of IPD and IDP PLSs.
