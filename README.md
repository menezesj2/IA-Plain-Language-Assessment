# Calling It Plain Language Does Not Make It So: Evaluating Accessibility in Documents for Early Public Participation in Impact Assessment

For my Master's project, I looked at how easy it is for people in Canada to read and understand summaries about major development projects—like new mines, roads, or energy sites. These summaries are part of something called an **Impact Assessment (IA)**, a process used to help decide if a project should go ahead and what effects it might have on people and nature.

Under Canada’s **Impact Assessment Act, 2019 (IAA 2019)**, companies must share a short version of their project description in **plain language**. This is to help people understand the project and take part early in the process. My goal was to see how well these plain language summaries were written and if they are easy for most people to use.

I reviewed 17 of these documents. To do this, I created a tool called the **Impact Assessment Plain Language Audit Tool (IA-PLAT)**. It helped me check how readable each summary was, how clearly the ideas were explained, and how much of the text was copied directly from longer technical documents.

### What I Found:

- Many summaries included helpful information and made a good effort to explain the project.
- Some used clearer language and better structure than others, and a few stood out as being more accessible.
- But overall, most summaries were written at a higher reading level than what’s recommended for public materials. The average was closer to university-level reading, while many Canadians read at a high school level or lower.
- Some summaries were long and took a while to read, which might make it harder for busy people to take part.
- In many cases, large sections were copied from the full technical report without much change.

Creating plain language content is not always easy—especially for technical topics. The companies preparing these summaries are often focused on meeting legal requirements, and they may not always have the tools or training to write for a general audience.

Still, I believe there are opportunities to improve. For example:

- Clearer guidance, examples, and templates could help writers prepare summaries that are easier to read.
- Training and support for both companies and government reviewers could also make a big difference.

**Plain language helps everyone.** It makes it easier to understand important information, take part in decisions, and feel heard. By making these summaries more accessible, we can support fairness, transparency, and better public engagement in environmental decisions.

I hope my research helps others think more about how we share information with the public—and how we can do it in a way that welcomes everyone.
